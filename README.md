Ai2AGI
This repository focuses on transitioning from AI to 
AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), 
developing cognitive systems that 
evolve and enhance themselves. 
It combines neural network architectures, 
evolutionary algorithms, 
and decision-making processes to simulate intelligent behavior.
